Services/providers
Services are responsible for combining or orchestrating multiple internal operations to implement a business logic (services), while providers implement the interface with external systems.
Services typically use repositories for data access to implement complex business logic rather than simple data retrieval and mutation operations. Each module of your application can have its own service.
Providers are similar to services but are specialized in interacting with external systems such as internal/third-party APIs. Examples of providers
include clients for email servers, payment gateways, or other microservices.
Essentially, both providers and services support implementation of controller business logic by facilitating internal and external interactions.
Here is an example of how they work together within a route controller: the users database service fetches a userâ€™s record by email and then uses that
information with a payment gateway and email server clients (providers) for processing payments and sending confirmation emails.
